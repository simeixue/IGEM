                            <h2>Introduction</h2>
                            <p>On this page, we present our contributions to the iGEM community. In our project, we have developed several skills, and we hope to pass them on to the future generations of the iGEM teams. If their designs also contain reactions of nucleic acids, what we have done may bring them choices or inspirations. We hope that our project can help the teams that choose the diagnostic track in the future. If we can also help and influence the teams on other tracks, that would be great.</p>

                            <h2>Parts</h2>
                            <p>Our team contributed to the iGEM Registry through adding new components. Klenow is the large fragment of the E. coli polymerase I. We hope to use its 5'-3' polymerization and strand displacement activities, but wipe off its 3'-5' exonuclease activity. Therefore, through site-directed mutagenesis, we generated a polymerase that was deficient of the exonuclease activity: Klenow mut-SH3 <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3894012" class="hyperlink"> [BBa_K3894012] </a>Part:BBa K3894012 - parts.igem.org. We constructed an engineering plasmid and successfully expressed the Klenow-mut. In our project, it is used for single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) replacement, and these point mutations protect our ssDNA from being degraded. Therefore, if future teams have similar application scenarios like ours, they can consider using this new part provided by us.</p>
                            <p>When multi-enzyme reactions are involved, fusion protein expression or in vitro protein assembly may be needed in the experimental designs. Our project provides helpful concepts on this aspect. We have tried to construct different fusion proteins, but encountered difficulties, including low expression levels and poor quality of purified recombinant proteins. Through the communication with other teams and the help of our faculty members, we designed an in vitro assembly strategy. Different from the popularly used Spy tag/catcher system in the Part library, we used the Src homology domain 3 (SH3) and its specific proline-rich ligand (slig) to assemble two purified recombinant proteins. The SH3/slig system is relatively small. Through our verification, the presence of SH3 and slig sequences does not affect the original activity of the proteins, which may meet the requirement of some special design scenarios. </p>
                            <p>We also added other new components <a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_K3894018" class="hyperlink">[BBa_K3894018]</a> Part:BBa K3894018 - parts.igem.org. BbvC R2 is one of the two heterologous subunits of the restriction enzyme R.BbvC. The recognition sequence of the restriction endonuclease BbvCI from Bacillus brevis is CC^TCAGC/GC^TGAGG. Among the two subunits, the R2 subunit cleaves the top strand CC^TCAGC. We mutated a 3-nucleitide sequence of BbvC R2 to generate a mutant that only recognizes and bind the target sequence, but does not cleave it when forming a dimeric enzyme. In this case, the other subunit will cleave the DNA to generate a nick. We hope to provide reference work and experience to the subsequent iGEM team for their selection of nickases and enzymes with strand displacement activity through our experiments.</p>

                            <h2>CRISPR Guideline</h2>
                            <p>Our team used the CRISPR/nCas9 this year for the design of CRISPR. Regarding the problems encountered in the design and experimental process, we attended an online CRISPR conference, and communicated with other iGEM teams that used the CRISPR technology. The CRISPR Guideline may help the future iGEM team when using the CRISPR technology. If anyone wants to learn more about the CRISPR conference, click here. (link)</p>

                            <h2>Hardware</h2>
                            <p>Our hardware part is mainly composed of a heat preservation device that can be used for the extraction of nucleic acid and storage of reaction solutions. Our whole device is easy to be used in detecting color changes. It is light, portable, and easy to be transported, which greatly reduces the test cost. For the popularization of our method, the device can be used at home and different outdoor scenes. Our heat preservation device can provide a suitable temperature for the reaction solution, and can also implement a high-temperature inactivation state after a nucleic test is completed, which prevents potential contamination to the environment. We hope our design can provide inspiration to the subsequent iGEM teams that need to use different reaction conditions in their projects. </p>
